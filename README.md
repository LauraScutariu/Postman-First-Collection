# Postman-Project

What is Postman?

Postman is a tool that allows us to easily work with APIs.
Postman is used to build HTTP requests that we send to the server running the API.

To use an API you need to read the API documentation. We're using Spotify API whose documentation can be found in the resources section of this lesson below.
Work in Postman is organized in Workspaces.
A status code 200 (or any status like 2XX) indicates that the request was successful.
